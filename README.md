# ME5401 Linear Systems Project

This repository contains the MATLAB code, report, and Simulink models for the project of the course ME5401: Linear Systems. The project utilizes MATLAB with the Control Tool Box.

## Contents

- **MATLAB Code**: The MATLAB scripts and functions used for the analysis and simulation of the linear systems.
- **Simulink Models**: Simulink models that simulate the behavior of linear systems.
- **Report**: The detailed project report that explains the approach, methods, and results.

## Requirements

To run the models and code, you need:
- MATLAB (Recommended Version: R2020b or later)
- Control Tool Box for MATLAB

## Running the Code

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing this project.
2. Run the MATLAB code by executing the script(s) in the command window.
3. To simulate the systems, open the Simulink models and run the simulations.
4. View the project report for further details on the analysis, methods, and results.
